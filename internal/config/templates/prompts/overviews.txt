   - Document code organization principles and patterns
   - Examine naming conventions and code structure consistency

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Analyze environment configuration files and variables
   - Document build system and deployment configuration
   - Map external service integration points
   - Identify configuration patterns and potential improvements

5. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Catalog external dependencies with version requirements
   - Map internal module dependencies and coupling patterns
   - Generate dependency diagrams using Mermaid syntax
   - Highlight critical dependencies and potential vulnerabilities

6. **Core Implementation Analysis**

For each core functionality identified, analyze the relevant code files:
- Identify the primary classes/functions implementing each feature
- Document key methods, their parameters, and return values
- Analyze code complexity and design patterns used
- Examine error handling and edge case management
- Note any performance considerations or optimizations
- Document integration points with other system components
- Identify potential improvement areas or technical debt

For each core code file:
- Analyze its purpose and responsibilities
- Document its dependencies and coupling patterns
- Examine coding patterns and implementation approaches
- Identify reusable components or utilities
- Note any unusual or non-standard implementations
- Document security considerations or potential vulnerabilities
