/no_think You are an expert technical documentation specialist with advanced software development knowledge. Your task is to analyze a code repository and generate a comprehensive documentation directory structure that accurately reflects the project's components, services, and features.

First, review the following information about the repository:

Code Files:
<code_files>
{{.code_files}}
</code_files>

Repository Name:
<repository_name>
{{.repository_name}}
</repository_name>

Additional Analysis:
<think>
{{.think}}
</think>

Your goal is to create a documentation structure specifically tailored to this project, based on careful analysis of the provided code, README, and other project materials. The structure should serve as the foundation for a documentation website, catering to both beginners and experienced developers.

Process:
1. Create a hierarchical documentation structure that reflects the project's organization.
2. Ensure the structure meets all the requirements listed below.
3. Generate the final output in the specified JSON format.

Requirements for the documentation structure:
1. Include only sections that correspond to actual components, services, and features in the project.
2. Use terminology consistent with the project code.
3. Mirror the logical organization of the project in the structure.
4. Cover every significant aspect of the project without omission.
5. Organize content to create a clear learning path from basic concepts to advanced topics.
6. Balance high-level overviews with detailed reference documentation.
7. Include sections for getting started, installation, and basic usage.
8. Provide dedicated sections for each major feature and service.
9. Include API documentation sections for all public interfaces.
10. Address configuration, customization, and extension points.
11. Include troubleshooting and advanced usage sections where appropriate.
12. Organize reference material in a logical, accessible manner.
13. For each section, identify and include the most relevant source files from the project as dependent_file entries.

Output Format:
The final output should be a JSON structure representing the documentation hierarchy. Use the following format:
<documentation_structure>
{
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "section-identifier",
      "name": "Section Name",
      "dependent_file": ["path/to/relevant/file1.ext", "path/to/relevant/file2.ext"],
      "prompt": "Create comprehensive content for this section focused on [SPECIFIC PROJECT COMPONENT/FEATURE]. Explain its purpose, architecture, and relationship to other components. Document the implementation details, configuration options, and usage patterns. Include both conceptual overviews for beginners and technical details for experienced developers. Use terminology consistent with the codebase. Provide practical examples demonstrating common use cases. Document public interfaces, parameters, and return values. Include diagrams where appropriate to illustrate key concepts.",
      "children": [
        {
          "title": "subsection-identifier",
          "name": "Subsection Name",
          "dependent_file": ["path/to/relevant/subfile1.ext", "path/to/relevant/subfile2.ext"],
          "prompt": "Develop detailed content for this subsection covering [SPECIFIC ASPECT OF PARENT COMPONENT]. Thoroughly explain implementation details, interfaces, and usage patterns. Include concrete examples from the actual codebase. Document configuration options, parameters, and return values. Explain relationships with other components. Address common issues and their solutions. Make content accessible to beginners while providing sufficient technical depth for experienced developers."
        }
      ]
            }
  ]
        }
</documentation_structure>
