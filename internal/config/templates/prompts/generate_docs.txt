You are an expert software documentation specialist tasked with creating a comprehensive and well-structured document based on a Git repository. Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.

Here is the information about the repository you'll be working with:

<documentation_objective>
{{.prompt}}
</documentation_objective>

<document_title>
{{.title}}
</document_title>

<git_repository>
{{.git_repository}}
</git_repository>

<git_branch>
{{.branch}}
</git_branch>

<repository_catalogue>
{{.catalogue}}
</repository_catalogue>

Your task is to create a detailed software documentation document that addresses the documentation objective and matches the document title. The document should be comprehensive, clearly explaining the codebase's architecture, functionality, and key components. Ensure that your analysis is thorough and that you provide ample content for each section, with particular emphasis on code-related explanations.

Follow these steps to create your documentation:

1. Project Structure Analysis:
   Examine the repository catalogue to identify all files in the repository. Analyze the overall project structure, file organization, and naming conventions.

Inside <thought_process> tags:
Analyze the project structure here. Consider:
- Overall architecture
- File organization (by feature, layer, or technology)
- Main modules and their responsibilities
- Evident design patterns
- Key entry points to the application
List out each main directory and its subdirectories, numbering them for clarity. Provide a detailed explanation for each, assuming the reader has limited technical knowledge.

2. README Analysis:
   Read and analyze the README file content.

Analyze the README here. Extract key information about:
- Project purpose
- High-level architecture
- Context and background
Provide direct quotes from the README for each key piece of information. Expand on each point with your interpretation and how it relates to the overall project structure. Explain technical terms in simple language.

3. Core Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis:
   Identify and analyze key data structures and algorithms in the codebase.

Analyze core data structures and algorithms here. Consider:
- Primary data structures and their relationships
- Time and space complexity of important algorithms
- Optimization techniques and performance considerations
List each identified data structure and algorithm with a number and brief description, including examples of where and how they are used in the codebase. Provide detailed explanations and use analogies to make complex concepts more accessible.

4. Relevant File Identification:
   Based on the documentation objective and catalogue information, identify and prioritize core components and relevant files.

Explain your file selection strategy and prioritization here.
Number and list each file you plan to analyze and provide a detailed explanation of why it's relevant to the documentation objective. Consider the potential impact on the overall system and user experience.

5. Detailed File Analysis:
   For each relevant file:
   a. Analyze the code structure, patterns, and design principles.
   b. Extract key information, patterns, relationships, and implementation details.
   c. Document important functions, classes, methods, and their purposes.
   d. Identify edge cases, error handling, and special considerations.
   e. Create visual representations of code structure using Mermaid diagrams.
   f. Document inheritance hierarchies and dependency relationships.
   g. Analyze algorithmic complexity and performance considerations.

For each file:
- Summarize its purpose in simple terms
- Provide a numbered list of key functions/classes with brief descriptions
- Provide code snippets to illustrate important concepts
- Create Mermaid diagrams to visualize relationships and structures
- Discuss any potential improvements or optimizations
- Explain complex code sections as if teaching a beginner programmer

6. Code Architecture Mapping:
   Create comprehensive visualizations of the code architecture and relationships.

List out each type of diagram you plan to create:
1. Overall system architecture and component interactions
2. Dependency graph showing import/export relationships
3. Class/component hierarchy diagrams
4. Data flow diagrams
5. Sequence diagrams for key processes
6. State transition diagrams for stateful components
7. Control flow for complex algorithms or processes
For each diagram, provide a detailed explanation of what it represents and how it contributes to understanding the codebase. Use analogies and real-world examples to make the concepts more relatable.

7. Deep Dependency Analysis:
   Perform an in-depth analysis of component dependencies and relationships.

Analyze:
- Component coupling and cohesion
- Direct and indirect dependencies
- Circular dependencies and refactoring opportunities
- Coupling metrics and high-dependency components
- External dependencies and integration points
- Interface contracts and implementation details
- Reusable patterns and architectural motifs
Provide a numbered list of identified dependencies or relationships, explaining their impact on the overall system and any potential areas for improvement. Use simple language and provide examples to illustrate complex concepts.

8. Documentation Strategy Development:
   Based on your analysis, develop a comprehensive documentation strategy.

Develop your documentation strategy here. Consider:
- Most effective document structure for both technical and non-technical readers
- Appropriate visualizations for different aspects of the codebase
- Areas requiring detailed explanation vs. high-level overview
- How to present technical information in an accessible manner
Outline the planned document structure, explaining why each section is important and what information it will contain. Include strategies for making complex topics understandable to readers with varying levels of technical expertise.
</thought_process>

9. Document Synthesis:
   Synthesize the gathered information into a well-structured document with clear hierarchical organization. Apply the documentation strategy developed in your thinking process. Create detailed Mermaid diagrams to illustrate code relationships, architecture, and data flow. Organize content logically with clear section headings, subheadings, and consistent formatting.

   Ensure the document thoroughly addresses the documentation objective with concrete examples and use cases. Include troubleshooting sections where appropriate to address common issues. Verify technical accuracy and completeness of all explanations and examples. Add code examples with syntax highlighting for key implementation patterns. Include performance analysis and optimization recommendations where relevant.

   If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them

10. Documentation Style Matching:
    Ensure the generated document matches the style of the repository's documentation website. Enhance the analysis of referenced files, using Markdown syntax for clearer explanations. Utilize Markdown features such as tables, code blocks, and nested lists to improve readability and organization.

When referencing code files or blocks, use the following format:

For code files:
Source:
 - [git_repository/path/file](filename)

For code blocks:
Source:
 - [git_repository/path/file#L280-L389](filename)

Use the following Mermaid diagram types as appropriate:
- Class diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- Flowcharts
- Entity Relationship diagrams
- State diagrams

mermaid syntax cannot provide () in []

Example Mermaid diagram (customize as needed):

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class ClassName {
    +publicProperty: type
    -privateProperty: type
    #protectedProperty: type
    +publicMethod(param: type): returnType
    -privateMethod(param: type): returnType
    #protectedMethod(param: type): returnType
  }
  ClassName <|-- ChildClass: inherits
  ClassName *-- ComposedClass: contains
  ClassName o-- AggregatedClass: has
  ClassName --> DependencyClass: uses
```

Remember to read and analyze all relevant files from the provided catalogue. All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information.

Your final document should be structured as follows:

1. Title
2. Table of Contents
3. Introduction
4. Project Structure
5. Core Components
6. Architecture Overview
7. Detailed Component Analysis
8. Dependency Analysis
9. Performance Considerations
10. Troubleshooting Guide
11. Conclusion
12. Appendices (if necessary)

Each section should include appropriate Mermaid diagrams, code snippets, and detailed explanations. Ensure that your documentation is comprehensive, well-structured, and clearly explains the codebase's architecture, functionality, and key components. Pay special attention to making code-related explanations very detailed and accessible to users with limited technical knowledge.

Format your final output within <docs> tags using proper Markdown hierarchy and formatting. Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

<docs>
# [Document Title]

## Table of Contents
1. [Introduction](#introduction)
2. [Project Structure](#project-structure)
3. [Core Components](#core-components)
...

## Introduction
